# Morphological stellar mass

A workshop for predicting the total stellar mass of a galaxy, based on a single-band image.

# Image format

Use the log-scaled images (with automatic scaling value), and convert to jpg.

# Output and additional metadata

Use the M/L as the prediction target. Can include the g-band luminosity as well (so we actually get the stellar mass), but this would mostly be just for fun.
